# ALX Travel App: Milestone 2 - Models, Serializers, and Seeders
This repository, alx_travel_app_0x00, represents the completion of Milestone 2 for the ALX Travel App project. This milestone focused on establishing the foundational data structures and initial data population for the application.

## Project Overview
Milestone 2: Creating Models, Serializers, and Seeders

This phase of the project involved:

Defining the core database models (Listing, Booking, Review).

Creating serializers for effective API data representation.

Implementing a management command to seed the database with sample data.


### Create Models:

The Listing, Booking, and Review models were defined in listings/models.py.

Each model includes appropriate fields, relationships (e.g., ForeignKey for Listing in Booking and Review), and constraints as per the project requirements.

### Set Up Serializers:

Serializers for the Listing and Booking models were created in listings/serializers.py. These serializers are crucial for converting complex Django model instances into native Python datatypes that can be easily rendered into JSON, XML, or other content types.

### Implement Seeders:

A custom Django management command was implemented in listings/management/commands/seed.py. This command is responsible for populating the database with sample Listing data, facilitating development and testing.

### Run Seed Command:

The seeder command was tested successfully to populate the database with sample data, confirming its functionality.
